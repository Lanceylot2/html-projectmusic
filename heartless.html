                    Young Metro, Young Metro
                    
                    Never need a bitch, I'm what a bitch need (bitch need)
                    Tryna find the one that can fix me
                    I've been dodging death in the six-speed
                    Amphetamine got my stummy feelin' sickly
                    Yeah, I want it all now
                    I've been runnin' through the pussy, need a dog pound
                    Hundred models gettin' faded in the compound
                    Tryna love me but they never get a pulse down
                    
                    (Why?) 'Cause I'm heartless
                    And I'm back to my ways 'cause I'm heartless
                    All this money and this pain got me heartless
                    Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless
                    Said I'm heartless
                    Tryna be a better man but I'm heartless
                    Never be a wedding plan for the heartless
                    Low life for life 'cause I'm heartless (heartless)
                    
                    Said I'm heartless
                    So much pussy, it be fallin' out the pocket
                    Metro Boomin turn this ho into a moshpit
                    Tesla pill got me flyin' like a cockpit
                    Yeah, I gotta watch it
                    Call me up, turn that pussy to a faucet
                    Duffel bags full of drugs and a rocket
                    Stix drunk but he never miss a target
                    Photoshoots, I'm a star now (I'm a star)
                    I'm talking Time, Rolling Stone and Bazaar now (Bazaar)
                    Sellin' dreams to these girls with they guard down (what?)
                    Seven years I been swimmin' with the sharks now

                    I lost my heart and my mind
                    I try to always do right
                    I thought I lost you this time
                    You just came back in my life
                    You never gave up on me (why don't you?)
                    I'll never know what you see (why won't you?)
                    I don't do well when alone (oh, yeah)
